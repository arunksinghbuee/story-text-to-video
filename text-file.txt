Suddenly, his eyes fell upon a sight that made him forget his troubles. Hanging from a branch above, swaying gently in the breeze, were the most magnificent grapes he had ever seen! They were plump, juicy, and glistening in the sunlight. The fox’s mouth watered at the sight.
“I must have those grapes!” he declared. “Just one bite of that sweet fruit…”
But the grapes hung high on the branch, well beyond his reach. He leaped and stretched, but to no avail. He backed up, ran, and jumped again, but still, the grapes remained tantalizingly out of reach.

Exhausted and frustrated after numerous failed attempts, he collapsed beneath the tree.
“What a foolish fox I am!” he grumbled. “Jumping and straining for these sour grapes on this hot day! Who even wants these sour grapes anyway?”

With a flick of his tail, the fox turned and headed home, defeated.
And so, dear children, remember that sometimes, when we can’t have something, we may try to convince ourselves that we didn’t want it in the first place. Just like our friend the fox!
